	<p style="text-align:right;color:green;font-size:20px">Every person needs to have a life goal. They are recognised and helped in achieving their dreams and goals by a target. Those without a career plan have no reason to live. A person without direction is like a structure without pillars. They complain, get thrown out, and frequently blame fate.

Every person has unique goals. Some people desire to be lawyers, while others want to be doctors. Some people might be inspired to become teachers, while others might decide to imitate their favourite performer and become actors.

People adapt their goals to fit their environment. When choosing an objective, we should be extremely cautious because some objectives may mislead you. A person may encounter difficulties and challenges, but he or she should continue in trying until success is achieved.

Being a doctor and giving free checkups to people who cannot afford them is my life’s goal. I am aware that my goal is challenging, but in order to succeed, I must put in a lot of effort.

	<p style="text-align:left;color:red">An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life. In order to succeed in life, one must have a goal. My aim in life is to be a teacher. Teaching is a noble and responsible profession. I have come to know that the ever-increasing misery and distress, are due to the ignorance and illiteracy of the people of our country. So I have decided to spread education among the masses as much as possible within my humble power.

As a teacher, I shall try my best to impart man-making education. Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. Rather, I think that morality is the real honey of life. I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future. I do not know how far my aim will be successful. But I shall try my best.</p>
